After spending some time in the kitchen, I can confidently say that the naysayers are mistaken and missing out on some truly good eats. While a rare, pan seared breast is a great treat in and of itself, I wanted to make something that was tasty and accessible. Beef Bourguignon, or beef Burgundy is a French classic, and the venison-like breast meat of the sea ducks complimented the Bourguignon nicely. This hearty wine-based stew is the perfect meal for when the mercury drops, and pairs well with a variety of dark game meats.\n",

Take Brad Pitt for example. The Ad Astra star, 55, has been single since Angelina Jolie filed for divorce in September 2016 after two years of marriage and a total 12 years together. And because he was embroiled in a bitter two-year courtroom battle over their six children  Pitt and Jolie, 44, finally came to a custody agreement in November 2018  the star hasn't had a moment to pursue potential partners. Being a good father to Maddox, 18, Pax, 15, Zahara, 14, Shiloh, 13, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 11, is what Pitt has put his focus on most. \"They do simple things like cook or watch movies,\" a source told Us, noting that he also encourages them to pursue their hobbies. \"They love to hang out and talk. Brad talks to them about whatever is on their minds  he's a great listener.\" The Academy Award winner has even taken up a hobby of his own: sculpting. \"It's very therapeutic for him; it's his go-to outlet,\" another source told Us. \"He can get caught up in it and carried away to the point where he doesn't want to stop.\" Like Pitt, Keanu Reeves has also been single for quite a while. He was, however, seen bantering with his ex-girlfriend, China Chow, at an event in May 2019.

      "2892 - Gus is a 2,000 pound bull who lives on a beautiful farm in Millbrook, Ontario. He is a true gentle giant with a gentle disposition and a friendly nature. He wanders among his herd of cows who are also very happy here on this small chunk of paradise. They have hundreds of acres of lush, green meadow to graze on and ponds full of fresh water to drink. They even have a scratching post with brushes for soothing those itches. Gus is a big boy with big ears and a big itch inside one of them. He patiently waited for his turn at the post while Ethel had a good scratch. When he had the chance, he moved in for some relief. He rubbed his head and his ear and he seemed intent on trying to fit the big brush inside his ear to get at the right spot. Gus' buddy, Dave was watching all of this. Dave had come over for a visit that day, bringing Gus' favorite treat, an entire loaf of bread. Gus had devoured the loaf in under a minute and now he was a happy bull, except of the itch in his ear. Dave watched Gus trying his best to scratch that itch. In fact, the entire herd was gathered around Gus and they watched him as well. Eventually, Dave thought it best to lend a hand. Gus could use a little help from somebody with fingers and thumbs who could do a better job. Not all bulls would allow this, and not all bulls would even permit somebody to get so close to his females, but Gus is as relaxed as a bull can be. Dave walked up and started rubbing Gus' massive ear. Gus obviously appreciated the assistance and he moved his head to make things easier. He let out a few \"moos\" of contentment and then he wandered away. As Gus takes a few steps away from the brushes, we get a great look at his massive shoulders and rippling muscles. He weighs as much as ten very solid, grown men. Maybe it's because Gus isn't threatened by anything, or maybe it's sheer luck that he's so relaxed, but he doesn't ever react with aggression or hostility. Of course, trying to scratch the ear of a grown bull, or even getting this close to one, is not always wise. Gus is definitely an exception and, even at that, his massive size and strength make him an animal to be respected.\n",

      "5495 - Real talk. Demi Moore got candid about a variety of topics in her new book, Inside Out, including her famous exes, substance abuse struggles and her heartbreaking sexual assault. \"The same question kept going through my head: How did I get here?\" the 56-year-old actress began in the memoir, which was released on Tuesday, September 24. \"The husband who I'd thought was the love of my life had cheated on me and then decided he didn't want to work on our marriage. My children weren't speaking me. … Is this life? I wondered. Because if this is it, I'm done.\" Moore provided insight into all three of her marriages in the book. She was married to Freddy Moore from 1980 to 1985, Bruce Willis from 1987 to 2000 and Ashton Kutcher from 2005 to 2013. The end of the G.I. Jane star's relationship with the former That 70's Show star, however, seemed to have the biggest impact on her. \"I lost me,\" the Ghost actress told Diane Sawyer on Good Morning America on Monday, September 23, about their split. \"I think the thing if I were to look back, I would say I blinded myself and I lost myself.\" Moore and Kutcher, who is 15 years her junior, started dating in 2003. After Us Weekly broke the news that he was allegedly unfaithful in 2011, the twosome called it quits. The Ranch star married Mila Kunis in July 2015. They share two kids: Wyatt, 4, and Dimitri, 2. Kutcher, for his part, reflected on the divorce during an appearance on Dax Shepard's \"Armchair Expert\" podcast last year. \"Right after I got divorced, I went to the mountains for a week by myself,\" Kutcher told Shepard in February 2018. \"I did no food, no drink  just water and tea. I took all my computers away, my phone, my everything. I was there by myself, so there was no talking. I just had a notepad, a pen and water and tea  for a week.\" He referred to the trip as \"really spiritual and kind of awesome.\" \"I wrote down every single relationship that I had where I felt like there was some grudge or some anything, regret, anything,\" Kutcher explained. \"And I wrote letters to every single person, and on day seven, I typed them all out and then sent them.\" While Moore certainly doesn't hold back in Inside Out, a source told Us earlier this month that the Kutcher isn't worried about the book. \"Ashton knew what was coming. He had a heads up on what is in the book,\" the insider said on September 13. \"He's not mad or disappointed. This is Demi's truth, and he always felt sympathetic toward her. He knows her story and that her upbringing was difficult.\" Inside Out is available now. Scroll through for 10 revelations from the book:\n",

      "6341 - The Battles began on The Voice Monday, with a new set of mentors (Usher, Darius Rucker, Normani, and wil.i.am) and a new rule allowing coaches to save one contestant each from elimination. But before all that, there were a few more Blind Auditions, including one form Season 17's new heartthrob, Matthew McQueen. He may not be related to Steve McQueen, but he had undeniable star power -- with a pretty face and a pretty voice to match plus just the right about of darkness and edge. \"He kind of looks like a combination of Tom Cruise and Christian Bale. You're like a very handsome movie villain,\" John Legend told Matthew. \"Like a vampire. You could be in a vampire movie,\" said Kelly Clarkson, who seemed a little flustered as she called the 21-year-old indie-pop crooner \"so cool and sexy -- I mean, not in a weird way!\" Blake Shelton compared Matthew's modern-sounding vocals to that of another heartthrob, Shawn Mendes. So I guess music really was in Matthew's, um, blood. [insert/quote some tweets] Matthew's cover artist-of-the-moment's Lewis Capaldi's weeper \"Someone You Loved\" was haunting, and not just because he looked like Lestat while singing it. I was impressed by his sense of dynamics, the way he started soft and subtle and built the song to its anguished crescendo, instead of starting at full volume. It was a sophisticated and nuanced performance. \"You got better and better and you kept it classy, you kept it tasteful. When you get into that rasp -- like, whew,\" Kelly marveled. It seemed like Kelly might be on her way to a third victory by getting Matthew on her team, but unfortunately for her, Blake also turned around. He made a very good case, noting that three of his past six winners were not country singers, stating, \"It doesn't matter what lane your coach is in. It's what lane your coach can put you in.\" Combine that with the fact that Grandma McQueen had dreamed that Blake would turn for Matthew, and it was a done deal. Now Blake might win again with another non-country artist. \"With his range and his pocket -- this guy is a threat to this entire competition,\" Blake proclaimed.\n",

The pigs are wild and they live on the edge of a jungle around a village on Vava'u Island in Tonga. Pigs are farmed here but they often run free, grazing and eating whatever they can find. Many pigs are fully wild, like this one and they can be seen foraging for food in compost heaps, farmer's fields, and under fruit trees. This very loving mother has ten piglets and they are extremely hungry. She lies down on the ground every few hours to let them feed. They nurse hungrily, climbing on each other adorably as they scramble for a chance at the best milk. This mother was also seen hiding her piglets in a little thicket so she could lie down beside them and sleep. Fiercely protective, the mother pig would be a formidable opponent for any dog or other predator who decided to try harming one of these little piglets. They will feed and grow rapidly under her watchful eye. They will need to be fast and strong if they want to survive life in the jungle. Tonga is a beautiful Kingdom with islands surrounded by crystal blue water. A visit here is like stepping back in time as guests witness a simple lifestyle and traditional ways. The Kingdom has not been industrialized as heavily as North America or Europe, and the people here enjoy a beautiful and natural home. But life is also hard and they work for everything, including food. Pigs like these are harvested as a food source by many. Hopefully, these little piglets will learn quickly and keep their wits about them.\n",
